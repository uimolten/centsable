This change fixes a bug where HTML `<b>` tags were displayed as plain text in some lesson components. I've updated the `GoalBuilderStep` and `ConceptCard` components to correctly parse and render these tags, ensuring that key terms are properly bolded for emphasis. I also performed a comprehensive review of all lesson files to ensure consistent formatting and corrected several instances where bold tags were missing or improperly applied, which will improve readability and the overall learning experience across the entire app.
